angular_spectrum_method.py calculates the wavefield plane-parallel to a given wavefield with the angular spectrum method.
This allows for calculation of the propagation of a monochromatic wave.
Here shown is the propagation of a wavefield with a cubic phase and an additional quadratic lens phase, giving an Airy beam
at the backfocal plane.
