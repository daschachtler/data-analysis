Time-resolved pump probe measurements done at the ARTEMIS Laser facility at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory outside of Oxford.
Approximately one hundred measurements needed to be analysed, therefore i wrote a script which processes and visualizes the input data kind of automatically. 
I show here images of the analysis of two measurements. The script can do a lot with the data, also movies etc.
